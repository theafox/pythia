class BaseMapping(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for defining translator-mappings.

    This class serves as a blueprint for creating specific mappings that map
    specific types of `ast` nodes. Each mapping must therefore implement the
    `map` method.

    Each mapping should use the provided `Context` instance for adding lines,
    translating sub-nodes, generating unique information, â€¦. Furthermore, the
    return value of the `map` method is only relevant for expressions (which
    do not take up whole lines). In case the mapping translates a statement (no
    return value required) or a non-fatal error is encountered, it is
    recommended return the string representation of the given node to showcase
    the interrupted translation of this node in the resulting translation. In
    case of an error during the mapping, raise `MappingError`.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: In case the `map` method was not overridden

            MappingError: In case a fatal error occured during translation

                translation. In case of a non-fatal error, simply return the
                string representation of the node, highlighting a missing
                proper translation for this node in the resulting translation.

        Returns:
            The mapping in case of an expression. In case of statements, the
            return value is meaningless, it is recommended to return the string
