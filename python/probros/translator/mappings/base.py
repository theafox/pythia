    """Abstract base class for defining translator-mappings.

    This class serves as a blueprint for creating specific mappings that map
    specific types of `ast` nodes. Each mapping must therefore implement the
    `map` method.

    Each mapping should use the provided `Context` instance for adding lines,
    translating sub-nodes, generating unique information, â€¦. Furthermore, the
    return value of the `map` method is only relevant for expressions ( do not
    take up whole lines, i.e. no statements). In case a non-fatal error is
    encountered, raise `MappingWarning`, and in case of a fatal error, raise
    `MappingError`.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: In case the `map` method was not overridden
                properly.
            MappingWarning: In case a non-fatal error is encountered during
                translation, the remaining translation may still continue.
            MappingError: In case a fatal error occured during translation
                which requires the user's attention or invalidates the whole
                translation. In case of a non-fatal error, simply return the
                string representation of the node, highlighting a missing
                proper translation for this node in the resulting translation.

        Returns:
            The mapping in case of an expression. In case of statements, the
            return value is meaningless, it is recommended to return the string
            representation of the node in that case.
